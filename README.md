# Unearth

***
Unearth is a prototype for a new social media platform. The goal is to easily expose local digital artists to people in their surrounding area.

Makes use of ReactJS, React-Redux, Redux-Thunk on the client side and Express with PostgreSQL on the server side.

Credits to geodatasource for their distance finder function.
