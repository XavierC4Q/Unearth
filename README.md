# Unearth

***
Unearth is a prototype for a new social media platform. The goal is to easily expose local digital artists to people in their surrounding area.

Create an account, add your social media when you edit you account, and view a feed with other nearby users based on the distance you set.

Makes use of ReactJS, React-Redux, Redux-Thunk on the client side and Express with PostgreSQL on the server side.

Credits to geodatasource for their distance finder function.
